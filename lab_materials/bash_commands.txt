------------------------------ SOME BASIC BASH COMMANDS ----------------------------- 

cat <path>                 # Print the whole content of a file into the terminal
cd <path>                  # Move to path location, home folder if no path was provided 
cp <source> <destination>  # Copy a file 
        -r                 ## Copy directory 
echo <what>                # Print something into the terminal
grep <what> <where>        # Search for occurrences of <what> in <where>
        -i                 ## Make search case insensitive 
        -v                 ## Invert the match 
        -c                 ## Counts matched instances 
        -w                 ## Match the whole word
        -m<num>            ## Stop after <num> matches 
        -n                 ## Display the line number of the matches
        -A<num>            ## Add <num> lines after the match
        -B<num>            ## Add <num> lines before the match
        -C<num>            ## Add <num> lines after and before the match
head <path>                # Print first 10 lines (default) of a file 
less <path>                # Visualize, without modifying, the content of a file 
ls                         # List content of the current directory
        -lh *.txt          ## Only list files matching some parameter
man <command>              # Show info for <command> 
mkdir <path>               # Create a directory
mv <source> <destination>  # Move a file 
rm <path>                  # Remove file
        -r                 ## Remove folder 
tail <path>                # Print last 10 lines (default) of a file 


-------------------------------- MISCELLANEOUS SINTAX ------------------------------- 
 
$(date)                    # Retrieves current time and date 
..                         # Refers to the parent directory 
<command1> | <command2>    # Concatenate commands
< > >>                     # Used to redirect the output of a command
>>                         # Used also to append content to a file 


! When copying or moving, the destination path defines the name of the file
  in the new folder, so to rename a file just change the name there 
! When concatenating commands, the output of the former becomes the input for
  the latter (even if it would print to terminal)
