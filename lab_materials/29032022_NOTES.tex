diverse yet-unexplored portion of microbiome in westernized and not westernized countries

Amplicon sequencing and for microbiome diversity exploring. 
Shotgun sequencing is an alternative.

uSGBs are unknown SGBs, no reference in the cluster. 
High quality reconstructed genomes, medium quality genomes too. Reference genomes are then clustered,
Taxonomic characterization.
