sequencing along doesn't permit to calculate precise amoutns. 

strain level analysis with metagenomic data. OTUs are not really specific to a given species. With metagenomic data, you can distinguish species. 
different use of informations.

strain level profiling.
\begin{itemize}
	\item identify strains, check the presence, 
	\item it is important to discover new strains.
	\item Track the same strain across the samples 
	\item Characterie genomically the strains found. 
\end{itemize}\\

E. coli presents a pangenome of 20000 genes, group genes into functinal gene-families. accessory or unique genes. 
Metagenomics sample mapped against E.coli Genomes. Estimate abundance in the community, and recapitulate with the covarage of each gene family in the pan-genome. \\

Thousand of genes with the same abundance. \\

...


PaPhIAn was red with the genes on the left. It is possible to view the genes characterizing a strain.\\

Eubacterium rectale common in humans, onyl 1 reference genome, still it was possible to see a structure. specific genes associate to cohorts. 3 possible groups identified, one from chinese, 1 from the Zeller cancer in the green group.\\

Preterm infants, Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Escherichia coli really high in 20\% infants. Different strains found (different IDs), two clades caused NEC, idea of which genes present in the metagenome. \\

SNPs, core genes compared to species specific markers. ...\\

Comparing different subjects. \\
\\
subspecies. Bacteria most present in the world. The abundancy over different populations in the world are really different, not balanced. \\
Variability of the species. some are really variable. some other not, Bacteroide could ave diverged in a short time and so ipotetically why the variance is so low.
